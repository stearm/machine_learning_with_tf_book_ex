## Exercise and pieces of code from the book "Machine Learning with Tensor Flow"

First of all, I advise you to read [this](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow) book.
I'm reading it after studying the theory under the main machine learning algorithms from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
